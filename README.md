## Methodoly used while implementing Feature :-

Session Description Protocol (SDP): Information about a peer that the other peer needs in order to make p2p connection.

->Signalling Using( Django server) required to exchange SDPs.
->Both peers connect to signalling servers using WebSocket.
->After SDPs are exchanged from both sides, p2p connection can be established.
->Signalling (Django) server not required afterwards

1. Peer joins room
2. Sends message to all other peers indicating its entry
3. All other peers get notified of new peer through this message 4. each existing peer initiates peer connection with new peer (offer
5. New peer receives each offer sdp
7. New peer sends response (answer sdp) for each offer sdp
8. Other peers receive respective answer sdps 
9. New peer connected with each existing peer (mesh)
